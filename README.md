Data Science for Supply Chain Forecasting Products with Statistical Models vs Machine Learning Tree-Based Models

'Applied Data Science to Supply Chain Forecasting'.

Excel or Python?

A paradigm shift is necessary to pass manual approaches made in Excel to powerful automated models in Python. 'Data Science' is synonymous with scalability, automation and value generation by developing forecasting techniques that allow the company to be better prepared for future demand.

Hello everyone, this presentation is a summary of my experience applying 'Data Science' in the demand forecast of more than 60 products. It is distributed as follows:

1. Excel or Python?
2. Application of 'Data Science' in demand management
3. Old-School Statistics vs Machine Learning (Models, advantages and disadvantages)
4. Forecast KPI (Measurement of the quality of forecasting techniques)
5. Hands-on (S scripting development for each statistical and Machine Learning forecasting model, optimization and forecasting for the coming periods)
